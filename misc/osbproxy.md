# Setting up an OSB Proxy

## IBM Cloud Setup
- create an IBM Cloud account and upgrade it to a PayGo account.  If you already have a subscription account you can use that account.
- create a new resource group
- create a new access policy that grants Editor or Administrator permissions for the `IBM Cloud Platform` service to the user that will create the proxy

## Cloud Foundry Setup

I am not sure what to do here yet.....
